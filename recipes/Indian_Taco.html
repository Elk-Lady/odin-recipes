        <h2>What are they?</h2>
            <p>These fry bread tacos are a favorite at aboriginal pow wows all summer long. For easier eating, especially at picnics, cut cooked fry bread into crouton-sized pieces; divide onto individual plates before adding the remaining ingredients on top.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups lukewarm water</li>
                <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 (15 ounce) can kidney beans, drained</li>
                <li>1 (1.25 ounce) package chili seasoning mix</li>
                <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>2 cups chopped iceberg lettuce</li>
                <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>    
            </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl; stir in water until a slightly sticky dough forms. Set aside to rest while oil preheats.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 6 equal portions. Flatten each portion into a round disc the size of your palm.</li>
                <li>Fry dough discs, one at a time, in hot oil until bottoms are browned, about 2 minutes; flip with tongs and cook until browned on the other side, about 1 minute more. Drain fry bread on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
                <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in kidney beans and chili seasoning; cook until heated through, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Place each fry bread on a plate; top each with a portion of chili mixture, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.</li>
            </ol>
